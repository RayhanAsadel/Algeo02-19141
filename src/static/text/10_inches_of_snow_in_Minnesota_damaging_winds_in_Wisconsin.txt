MINNEAPOLIS (AP) â€” A November storm has dumped as much as 10 inches (25.40 centimeters) of snow in Minnesota and whipped up damaging winds in Wisconsin where tens of thousands were left without power. 
The Minnesota State Patrol handled hundreds of crashes and spinouts as snow piled up late Tuesday. Between 4:30 p.m. Tuesday and 7:30 a.m. Wednesday, troopers responded to 253 crashes, 258 vehicles that had spun out or slid off the road, and 17 jackknifed semitrailer trucks. Sixteen people were hurt in the crashes, but no weather-related deaths were reported, the patrol said. 
The National Weather Service record 5.5 inches (13.97 centimeters) of snow at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport with Brainerd picking up the most snow with 10.1 inches (25.65 centimeters). 
In northeastern Minnesota, Grand Rapids picked up 9.5 inches (24.13 centimeters), the weather service said.
